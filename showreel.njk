    <p>
        I was fortunate to work in the past 3 years with amazing clients on creatively challenging projects involving short films, animated illustrations, product trailers, social media campaigns, explainers, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        All animation in the showreel was exclusively done by me.
    </p>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a Berlin-based animator, illustrator, and motion designer.
        <b>My strong suit is hand-crafted 2D animation</b>
        that I draw frame-by-frame. I love to experiment with combining 3D and 2D techniques, to achieve unique effects, like the glass shattering in the car crash scene.
    </p>

    <p>
        And, I love working with startups! 
    </p>
    <p>My full range of services includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2D/3D Animation - for Product Trailers, Ads, Explainers</li>
        <li>Web Animation - CSS, SVG, Lottie, Parallax, and other code based animation</li>   
        <li>Sound Design</li>

    <p>I would be delighted to help your team out with a project. Or tell the whole story with you — from start to finish! Contact me via email: goscha(at)justgoscha.com</p>

    <p>
        Additionally I like to educate future animators and share what I learn on my journey through animation and technology. That's why <a href="/writing">I write about animation</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/justgoscha">create educational videos</a> and <a href="https://justgoscha.gumroad.com/">tools to make animators more productive!</a>

        You can contact me if you like me to talk at your event on the topic of animation and its cross-section with new technologies.
